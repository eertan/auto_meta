This is a repository that profiles and categorizes a set of given tables. The categorization is done with respect to a data model so that an ontology will be fitted to the data later on. The purpose is to identify:
1. What type each of the assets is
  a. Entity
  b. Event
  c. State
  d. Participation
2. What  the primary keys and foreign keys are if any for each asset.

Profiler module tries to identify the key information, decider categorizes the asset and validator checks for inconsistencies.
